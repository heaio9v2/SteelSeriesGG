# SteelSeriesGG
Workarounds to make SteelSeries GG work in a multiuser Windows environment.

# Background
SteelSeries hardware is great hardware; however, the software has a lot to be desired. For example, the SteelSeries GG application that backends the advanced capabilities of the SteelSeries Apex Pro and SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless does not work on a multiuser Windows 11 OS. But let me be clear, the software "works" in that it installs and launches; however, it does not work because on its own it launches multiple copies of itself and its backend proceses for each user who logs in which results in the keyboard and/or mouse glitching badly. 

So, with SteelSeries unable or unwilling to fix this issue I reported MANY months ago, this repo is intended to help mitigate the issues until SteelSeries can get their software development act together.
